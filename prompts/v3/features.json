Anime-style images are considered generated since they are not real photographs. Meanwhile, since generated images usually rely on natural language prompts, they may contain stereotypical content, such as a hen with red beak as red beak is a stereotype of hens, and thus likely to be generated. Plus, due to the nature of prompts, two different type of things never appear in the same image, such as a cat and a dog in the same image."
